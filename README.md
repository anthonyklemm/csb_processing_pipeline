CSB data pipeline for scraping, tide correction, spatial database population (duckdb-spatial), vertical offset analysis/correction, uncertainty estimation, vessel speed estimation and PMM imputation-based outlier detection algorithms, and exporting data as vessel-transit geopackages and geotiff DEMs. 

There are other helper scripts, and some scripts for dashboard/leaderboard creation as well.
